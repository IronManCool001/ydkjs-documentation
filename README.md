# You don't know js unofficial book site

My motivation for creating this site. Sometimes I have to go back to check the reference for concepts and searching in Github is not very good. 

*Note:* If you are comfortable reading from github. I would suggest read it from there. As it is the official source. This I created only for **learning** purpose.

All credit goes to **Kyle Simpson** for creating these wonderful books!

# TODO

- [ ] Currently it has only one book. Add more
- [ ] Add version 1 books also
- [ ] Add algolio support

# LICENSE

As long it is for learning purposes you are allowed to customize this project. Also read original [author]((https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)) license for modifying its content( *currently in this project `docs` is taken from that repo* )


# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. So lot of thing handled by docusaurus :-)

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
